The iris dataset contains four measurements for 150 flowers representing three species of iris (Iris setosa, versicolor and virginica). On this page (http://statlab.uni-heidelberg.de/data/iris/) there are photos of the three species, and some notes on classification based on sepal area versus petal area.

The Iris data set contains measurements in centimeters for the variables sepal length and width, and petal length and width, for 150 flowers from 3 species of iris, Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The data was collected over several years by Edgar Anderson, who used the data to show that the measurements could be used to differentiate between different species of irises.

The Iris Flower Dataset is a popular multivariate dataset that was introduced by R.A. Fisher as an example for discriminant analysis. The data reports on four characteristics of the three species of the Iris Flower, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of a discriminant analysis is to produce a simple function that, given the four measurements, will classify a flower correctly. This is the beginning of creating “predictors” in order to try to make a more educated guess on a record in a dataset.
